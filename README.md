# Silo Actions

UI boilerplate for quick actions.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run test
npm run build
```

GitHub Pages deployment is configured in `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

## Manual actions (when the app UI is unavailable)

Step-by-step instructions for doing the same thing inside a multisig UI (e.g. Safe{Wallet}). No deep technical background—only what to click and what to paste.

### Clear the supply queue (`setSupplyQueue` — empty queue)

**Option A — pick the method (contract interaction)**

1. In **Contract address** / **To**, paste the **vault contract address**
3. When methods are listed, choose **`setSupplyQueue`**.
4. For the **`_newSupplyQueue`** argument (address list), enter exactly **`[]`**

**Option B — raw calldata only (no method picker)**

1. Create a transaction whose **destination address** is the **vault address**
2. Use **raw data** / **hex** / **custom calldata** (wording depends on the Safe version).
3. Paste the **full** string below (one line, including the `0x` prefix):

   ```
0x4e083eb300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   ```
